// The version caption under the wordmark. It is decoration with a fact in it,
// and both halves of that are load-bearing.
//
// The fact: it must keep following whatever shipped. `boot()` already carries
// app.getVersion() into the renderer as S.version, so the label is correct for
// free — but only while it is fed from there. A literal version string in the
// markup would look identical on the day it was written and be a lie by the
// next release, so this file refuses one.
//
// The decoration: it must stay quiet, and it must not disturb the lockup it
// hangs off. `.brand` is 26px and the mascot and wordmark share a centre line
// inside it; a caption that takes part in that flow pushes the wordmark up.
// Absolute positioning is what keeps it out of the flow, so that is asserted
// rather than assumed. Geometry beyond that — the 2.5-3.3px gap under the ink,
// the sub-pixel left alignment — was measured in a real engine at build time
// and cannot be re-measured from static text; what is checked here is the
// structure those measurements depend on.
