// The markdown editor paints its text twice and stacks the two layers: a
// transparent <textarea> holding the caret, over a <pre> painting the colours.
// Every character lines up only while both layers lay out identically, and
// nothing in CSS said so — a single `font-size` on a heading span put the caret
// four characters away from the letter it appeared to sit on. You clicked a
// word you could see and backspace ate a different one.
//
// So the rule is written down here instead of remembered: a declaration that
// changes where a glyph lands must apply to BOTH layers or NEITHER. Colour,
// weight and slant are deliberately allowed — each measured at 0.0px of drift,
// because every content face any theme uses here is fixed-pitch across weights
// (Courier Prime's four vendored faces, and operator's SF Mono/Menlo stack all
// share one advance width) — and the editor would lose its syntax colouring
// without them. A theme whose content face is NOT fixed-pitch would break this
// assumption; don't add one to the editor.
//
// The same contract now covers .ed-measure, the invisible third layer whose
// per-line blocks give the gutter its wrapped row heights — it sits in the
// shared rule, so it wraps exactly where the textarea does.
