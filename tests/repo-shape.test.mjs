// What is allowed to be public, checked rather than remembered.
//
// The repo went public with fourteen planning documents, a folder of agent
// definitions and ten megabytes of unused artwork in it, because nothing said
// otherwise. Ignore rules only ever block what somebody already thought of: a
// folder invented tomorrow — notes/, drafts/, experiments/ — is not on any list
// and `git add -A` takes it up without a word.
//
// So this works the other way round. Everything tracked must live somewhere
// named below; anything else fails until a person decides it belongs. The
// release workflow runs `npm test` as its gate, so a repo that has drifted
// cannot become a download.
