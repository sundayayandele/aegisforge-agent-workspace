# Contributing to Nami

Nami is an Electron app in plain JavaScript. No bundler, no framework, no build
step for the UI — you edit a file and restart.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrdainami/nami.git
cd nami
npm install
npm start
```

```bash
npm test        # node --test, no network and no model download needed
npm run shot    # renders a demo-seeded screenshot to shots/app.png
```

## Two copies, and why

Nami is comfortable to build Nami in, so you will end up running two of it.
Keep them apart.

- **`npm start`** runs this checkout. It is what you look at while working:
  no build, no wait, and Electron gives it its own `userData` (`Nami-dev`), so
  your real settings, keys and open projects are never touched.
- **`/Applications/Nami.app`** is the version other people have. Leave it alone
  and it stays an honest answer to "what does a user see?", which nothing else
  can tell you.

Installing your own build over it is a deliberate act, not the daily loop:

```bash
npm run pack && npm run install-local
```

`install-local` refuses to overwrite a running app, because doing so leaves it
reading a bundle that no longer exists.

Building a `.app` or `.dmg` (`npm run pack` / `npm run dist`) first runs
`npm run fetch-model`, which pulls `whisper-tiny.en` (~44 MB) into `build/models`
so the shipped app can transcribe offline. Packaging config lives in
`electron-builder.yml`.

## Layout

- `src/main/main.js` — Electron main: window, PTYs, folder + `.claude` scan, state, IPC
- `src/main/claude-driver.js` — one Claude Code session → paper-card events
- `src/main/settings.js` — settings.json, read-merge-rename so writers can't clobber
- `src/main/stt.js` — transcription providers as one registry (local, openai, elevenlabs, custom)
- `src/main/stt-local.js` / `stt-model.js` — Whisper on onnxruntime-node, and its weights
- `src/main/preload.js` — contextBridge IPC surface
- `src/renderer/` — the paper UI (`app.js`, `paper.css`, vendored xterm)
- `docs/design.md` — the approved design · `docs/media/` — what it looks like now

State persists to `userData/state.json` (projects, sessions), so a
restart restores the desk.

## How the pieces behave

- **Agent sessions** run the agent's own CLI in a real PTY (node-pty) inside
  an ink-on-paper xterm. Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Grok and the rest each keep
  their TUI; Nami is the desk around them.
- **Sessions survive restarts** — editors and viewers reopen, terminals
  restart in their folder, and Claude sessions pick their conversation back up
  via `claude --resume` of the pinned id.
- **The launcher** (⌘N) shows the agents actually installed on your Mac, checked
  through your own shell at startup: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI,
  Hermes, Kimi Code. Missing ones open a guided setup sheet with the verified
  official install command, run for you inside a terminal tile.
- **Library** — the third rail tab, grouped into Agents / Skills / Services /
  Plugins, reading this project's `.claude/` and `.opencode/`, your user-level
  `~/.claude/` and `~/.config/opencode/`, and installed Claude plugins. Each item
  peeks as a paper card with a **Form** view and a **Markdown** toggle. Plugin
  items are read-only (their cache is overwritten on updates) with one-click
  **Duplicate to project**.
- **Services** writes each connection where the agent already looks — `.mcp.json`
  for Claude Code, OpenCode's config for OpenCode — and proves it by starting it
  once.
- **Connections** — agents and skills that reference each other show
  references/referenced-by chips, and **Map** opens a corkboard of the item's
  neighbourhood.
- **Voice** — Whisper runs on the local machine via onnxruntime-node, so dictation
  works on a fresh install with no account, key or network. Settings › Voice can
  point it at OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs Scribe, or an OpenAI-shaped server
  (Speaches or faster-whisper-server; **not** Ollama, which has no speech-to-text).

## Auth

Nami uses your logged-in `claude` (subscription), found at `~/.local/bin/claude`.
No API key is set. If your `claude` lives elsewhere, set
`CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/claude`.

## Settings

⌘, or the ⚙ in the topbar. **Voice** picks how Nami hears you, **Look** switches
desks, **Models** configures the OpenAI-compatible endpoint behind "any AI model"
sessions. Everything lands in `settings.json` under the app's userData, on that
Mac only — nothing syncs. API keys typed there beat `OPENAI_API_KEY` /
`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` from the shell; a key that came from the environment is
shown as read-only.

## Keys

⌘N new session · ⌘O open folder · ⌘K agents · ⌘W close pane · ⌘S save ·
⌘, settings · esc close

## Design

Everything is in the paper aesthetic: cream sheet, washi tape, Caveat
handwriting, Courier Prime, pastel-tinted cards, hard offset shadows. There are
four desks — paper, operator, glass, graphite — and a new surface has to work in
all four. Read `docs/design.md` before changing anything visual.

## Releasing

Tagging a version is the only thing that produces an installer:

```bash
npm version patch && git push --follow-tags
```

That builds from a clean checkout, signs and notarises, and creates a **draft**
release. Publishing it is a deliberate human step — the moment it goes live is
the moment every installed Nami starts offering it.

Each release carries two Mac builds of each architecture. The `.dmg` is what a
person downloads; the `.zip` is what an update installs, because on macOS the
swap is done by Squirrel, which can only unpack a zip. A release with no zip on
it is a release nothing can update to.

## Testing an update without publishing one

An updater is the one feature that can leave somebody with a broken install, so
the interesting case is not the one where it works. `scripts/fake-update.mjs`
serves a pretend newer Nami from this machine so both cases can be tried in
minutes instead of in releases.

The signature is the catch: Squirrel refuses an app whose code signature does
not match the one running, so both copies have to be real `npm run pack` builds
— editing the version inside an existing `.app` breaks its signature and the
update then fails for a reason that has nothing to do with your change.

```bash
npm run pack                                    # the old one
cp -R release/mac-arm64/Nami.app /Applications/Nami-test.app
# bump "version" in package.json
npm run pack                                    # the new one

node scripts/fake-update.mjs \
  --serve release/mac-arm64/Nami.app \
  --point /Applications/Nami-test.app
```

`--point` rewrites the installed copy's `Contents/Resources/app-update.yml` to
ask localhost instead of GitHub, keeping the original as `app-update.yml.real`.
Open `/Applications/Nami-test.app`, click **download** in the bar, quit it, and
open it again: it should come back as the new version.

Then the test that matters. Add `--corrupt`, which serves bytes that do not
match the hash in the metadata:

```bash
node scripts/fake-update.mjs --serve release/mac-arm64/Nami.app --corrupt
```

The download must fail and the bar must fall back to offering the dmg, and the
installed app must still be the old one, still working. If a corrupt download
ever installs, nothing else about the updater matters.

Put `package.json` back when you are done, and delete `/Applications/Nami-test.app`.
