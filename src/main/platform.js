// These assumptions used to be scattered as literals: '/bin/zsh' in four call
// sites, `command -v` inside a template string, three absolute paths where
// Claude Code might live, and a macOS-only titleBarStyle. Each was correct and
// each was invisible — nothing named them as platform decisions, so a port
// meant finding them by failure rather than by reading.
//
// Nami ships macOS-only on purpose (see the shipping spec), so the darwin
// column is the one that is exercised and verified. The win32 column is written
// from the documented install paths of each tool and is NOT verified — it
// exists so that adding Windows is filling in a table rather than an
// excavation, and every entry in it should be treated as a hypothesis until it
// has run on a real Windows machine.
//
// Pure by design: no electron, no fs, no process spawning, and platform is
// always a parameter. That keeps it testable from `node --test`, which cannot
// pretend to be Windows any other way.

// opencode and nvm among them. With `-lc` those lines are never read, so a
