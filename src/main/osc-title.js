// More importantly it is the ONLY title source that stays correct when the user
// runs /resume inside a tile: the transcript path nami watches is built from the
// session id it pinned at spawn, and /resume moves claude to a different
// conversation entirely (measured: pinned c602aba0… → live dddf8560…, with the
// pinned transcript never created). The title in the stream always belongs to
// whatever conversation claude is in right now.
//
// Pure on purpose — main.js owns the pty, this owns the parsing.
