// Notify-only on purpose: this asks GitHub what the latest release is, and if
// it is newer, main tells the renderer to show a bar. Clicking opens the dmg in
// a browser — the user installs it themselves. Nothing here downloads, unpacks
// or replaces anything.
//
// That restraint is deliberate. Replacing a running app in place is the step
// that needs Apple's blessing (a notarized build, verified before it is swapped
// in), and doing it wrong bricks the install. When notarization is live,
// electron-updater takes over and the only thing that changes is what happens
// on click — the deciding logic below stays exactly as it is, which is why it
// lives in its own file with the IO injected.
//
// The whole module is built to fail quietly. An update check is the app's own
// business: offline, rate-limited, behind a captive portal, or handed something
// that is not a release at all — every one of those ends as "no update", never
// as an error the user has to read.

// A dotted version as numbers, plus whether it carries a -prerelease tail.
// Anything unparseable comes back null so callers can treat it as "no answer".
