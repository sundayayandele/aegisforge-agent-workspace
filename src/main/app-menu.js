// The application menu: six menus, written out by hand, none of them Electron's.
//
// Nami shipped with Electron's stock menu, which is why the Nami menu offered
// Services, Hide Others and Show All, why Edit offered smart quotes to an app
// whose text is prompts and paths, and why About Nami opened the grey macOS
// panel that credited a person instead of the company. Nothing the app can
// actually do appeared up there: ⌘N, ⌘O, ⌘K, ⌘, and ⌘S all worked with no menu
// to say so, and a Mac user reads the menu bar to find out what an app can do.
//
// The catch, and the reason this file has tests: building a template replaces
// the default menu wholesale. Electron's default is not a starting point you
// extend, it is a thing you lose. Omit the Edit roles and ⌘C stops working
// everywhere, including inside the terminal; omit quit and ⌘Q goes with it. So
// every role that carries a key is restated here, and `menuRoles` walks the
// whole tree so a test can assert they are all still present rather than
// trusting the reading.
//
// Split the way platform.js is: a pure builder that returns a plain template
// (no electron import, so `node --test` can check it), and one thin function
// that hands the result to Electron.
