// Keeps the Workspace tree honest: one recursive watcher on the open project, so
// a file a session just wrote shows up without a click — wherever it landed.
//
// Recursive, and watching folders you have not opened, because that is the case
// that was broken. Watching only the root and the expanded folders meant an
// agent scaffolding into a collapsed ui/ fired nothing at all: the folder had no
// watcher, and writing inside it does not touch the root, so the root's watcher
// stayed silent too. The row said "0 items" over four files on disk and no
// amount of waiting fixed it — only collapsing the folder and opening it again.
//
// The earlier design went non-recursive on volume, arguing that a collapsed
// dist/ churning through a build was the difference between a watcher you keep
// and one you turn off. The concern is real; going blind is not the answer.
// Measured with 200 files landing in node_modules: 205 events, 202 of them
// dropped by the path test below before any work happened. Filter and coalesce.
//
// Two readers now, not one. The tree wants the folder; a file open on the desk
// wants to know whether it was the file that moved, so every flush carries the
// names as well — coalesced into a Set, absolute, and null when the platform
// declined to say which. See src/renderer/file-sync.mjs for what happens next.
//
// fs.watch is injectable so the tests never touch a real disk.
//
// Note this is the opposite call from watchTitle's poll in main.js, and
// deliberately so: transcripts are append-storms where a watcher fires
// constantly and tells you nothing new, while a directory listing changes
// rarely and every change matters.
