// Where each agent's program actually lives, according to the last scan.
//
// Nami answers "is this agent installed" properly in exactly one place:
// agents-detect asks the user's interactive login shell (`command -v claude`)
// and, if that comes back empty, walks the documented install folders. That
// answer knows about nvm, volta, asdf, mise, bun and any PATH line the user
// wrote themselves.
//
// Nothing else could read it. The SDK adapter re-derived the location from a
// hardcoded list of five paths, so a claude installed through a version manager
// was "ready" in the launcher and "isn't installed on this Mac yet" one click
// later in the card view. The one-shot adapters spawned a bare name against the
// login PATH captured once at app start, so an agent installed *inside* Nami
// stayed unspawnable until the app was restarted.
//
// So the scan writes here, and everything that spawns reads here. Deliberately
// a memo and not a source of truth: it holds only what a real scan reported,
// every reader falls back to what it did before, and a scan that stops finding
// an agent clears it rather than leaving a path that would ENOENT forever.
//
// The memo itself is process-local and has no I/O. resolveClaudeExecutable
// is the one reader that stats the disk, so Term spawn and the (retired)
// card adapter ask the same question.

// ---- spawn flags -----------------------------------------------------------
// Flags Nami always adds when it spawns a given agent, as opposed to anything
// the user or the resume path asked for.
//
// grok is the only entry and --minimal is the reason the table exists: without
// it grok paints a full-screen TUI over the Nami theme instead of printing
// into the tile's own scrollback the way claude does. It is session-scoped,
// so nothing is written to the user's ~/.grok/config.toml.
//
// Why here and not on the panel: agentForCommand (agent-resume.js) matches a
// tile's `command` against BARE binary names to gate resume and session
// discovery. Keeping `command` exactly 'grok' and adding the flag here, at
// the moment of spawn, leaves that check untouched.
//
// --minimal is marked Experimental in `grok --help` (1.0.5). If a release
// drops it grok falls back to its full-screen TUI: uglier against the theme,
// never broken.
const SPAWN_FLAGS = { grok: ['--minimal'] };

// Applied to the BARE command, before resolveRunCommand swaps in a scanned
// absolute path — at this point the head is still the binary's name, which is
// what the table is keyed by. Flags land ahead of the agent's own arguments so
// a resume line stays minimal too.
