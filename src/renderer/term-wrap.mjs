//
// A soft wrap — xterm running out of columns and folding the line itself —
// sets isWrapped on the continuation, and wrappedRow stitches the run back
// together before anything is scanned. That case is already handled and
// nothing here touches it.
//
// A hard wrap is the other thing. The program measured your width, chose the
// break, and printed its own newline with a hanging indent. Both rows carry
// isWrapped false, nothing joins them, and scanLinks matches the head of a
// severed URL as a complete one — so the click goes somewhere real and wrong,
// and widening the window never heals it because the newline is in the
// scrollback.
//
// The information was destroyed by the emitter, so this is inference, not
// recovery. Two guards keep it narrow. A row with space left in it was not
// cut off — whoever broke there meant to. And a continuation that starts at
// column 0 is a soft wrap, which is someone else's job. What remains is a row
// filled to its last column followed by a short indent and a character a link
// could actually contain.
//
// Pure functions over the smallest slice of a buffer line, so the whole thing
// is testable without a terminal — the same call term-links.mjs makes.

// Characters a URL or a path can contain in its body. Deliberately not the
// full RFC set: a continuation opening with a quote or a bracket is prose.
